Sipping his black coffee, Keith settled down on his most comfy couch. It’s Tuesday morning.

Keith turned on the TV to find out what was going on in Boston. He clicked through different news channels, which all had the same news.

Good Morning. My name is Lisa Francis and you are watching channel 25. Today is April 9th, 2019, Tuesday. We have so much interesting information for our viewers but,

We begin our day by unfolding the mystery of KARAM or now we can say, Kevin Anderson.

KARAM was the most wanted vandal in the United States of America. It's said that Kevin Anderson uses RAM in his name because he was an Aries zodiac. He is also involved in some sort of cult-related activities. By profession, he was an engineer and a hacker

Kevin was shot dead at 6:00 PM USA (GMT-4), on Monday, April 8th, 2019, near Boston, Parkman Bandstand.

From all the available information it's said that he got shot in the back of his head during his escape from Boston police officer Hector Ross…..

Keith put on his jacket, turned off the TV, finished his coffee, and walked outside of his apartment...

On April 8, 2019, Monday. The rain was about to start and the clouds were getting darker and darker. Today KARAM was at the wrong place at the wrong time.

 **********

It was 6:00 pm in the evening. The girls and Adam were sitting near the Earl of Sandwich. They were discussing the security measures they should take to be safe from the attack. It's not an easy job to do because they have tried so many tactics, but KARAM is always one step ahead of them.

There were many passers-by on the premises. One of them was in a black jacket with the hood on, spying on them from outside the tennis court. They all knew that there might be someone, somewhere around, spying on them, but they didn't know he would be that close.

It would be harder for the man in the black jacket to attack them because of Adam being with them. First, he had to distract him. Exactly five minutes later Adam walked a few meters away from the girls, but it was not the plan of the black jacket man. Whatever, He didn’t care, this moment was a gold coin for him.

The man walks slowly towards Edon. He tries to chloroform her. He failed because luck is not always on one person’s side, this time there was a sound heard by both of them, “Don’t move. You are under arrest” officer Hector shouted, with his gun pointed towards the black jacket man. That man was supposed to be Adam who called the police but nothing was clear now.

The man in the back jacket ran towards the Parkman, Bandstand. It's easier for him to hide somewhere in the dark. The rain had started, and it was making the ground look like a lake, which was creating difficulties for him to run.

As he reached closer to the bandstand, officer Hector shouted,” Stop it, or I’ll shoot”. Rain is also creating difficulty for him to listen to the clear sound of what officer Hector was saying.

Officer had shot the bullet, and it hit the black jacket man in the middle of the skull from the back. He fell down on his face, motionless, and the blood was getting washed away in the rain. Officer Hector called the police jeep to take away the body.

The group of girls standing a few meters away from the dead body, holding hands and standing close to each other. Edon was getting curious and she went closer to the body. “Your game is over” She whispered. She tried to check his identity, but officer Hector said ”don’t touch the body”. “I just want to see his face and ID card,” Edon asked Politely.

Officer turned the body over and took out his wallet to show the ID to the girl, “Kevin Anderson” Edon read aloud his name. Every one of them came close to the body to see the face of evil, which haunted them for years
